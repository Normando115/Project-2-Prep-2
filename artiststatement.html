<h1> Artist Statement</h1>
<p> My concept for this is a dancing a ball in a dark room. The floor changes color to give the room </p>
<p>some depth and the ball colors rotate. This project was my most confusing one as I went into this </p>
<p>project late and what I wanted to do was very difficult as there were many errors along the way from </p>
<p>the beginning to the very end. I originally wanted to do a disco room with flashing lights and gradual </p>
<p>changes but that didn't happen because after days of no progress I changed to this. My intentions for </p>
<p>making the dancing ball was to emulate what its like for someone to practice for hours doing the same  </p>
<p>thing over and over to perfection practice for hours doing the same thing over and over to perfection. </p>
